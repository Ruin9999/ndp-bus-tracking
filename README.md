<p>A website to help keep track of bus data during NDP.</p>

<h2 align="center">About</h2>
<p>This project was made to help ease the jobs of the transport OPS team during the rehearsals and preparations for Singapore's National Day Parade on both the 9th and 21st of August 2021.</p>

<h2 align="center">Where did all the code go?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, due to some issues a backup wasn't made and the code was lost. I do plan to get it back up and running again for 2022 but for now it is just here for my portfolio.</p>
